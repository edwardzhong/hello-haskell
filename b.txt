I remember long ago 
记得很久以前
When the world and we were young 
世间的一切和我们都还年少
And every day moved in-slow motion... 
时间一天天慢慢地流逝
Those days are far away 
如今那些日子都已远去
Lost in a sea of time 
消逝于时光之海中
Our dreams are old and there's no knowing... 
梦想逐渐老去，无人所知

I remember all our plans 
还记得我们所有的宏图壮志
And the crazy hopes we had 
我们内心的狂热期盼
But through the years we've grown more sober... 
时光流逝，我们越来越冷静
We're happy for the times 
但仍怀念那个时代
And moments that we had 
怀念那些经历的瞬间
You gotta feel alive before life is over... 
一定要真真切切地活着 ，直到生命终止
